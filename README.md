## Description:
##### This application is two fold, it is both a website and android mobile app. Both can be used as independent systems to easily build and study flashcards. They manage user profiles and remember flashcards from session to session making it easy to leave the application and rejoin whenever it becomes conveient again. The whole idea was to make studying for our finals easier and we found combining traditional study tactics and development in the process to help us learn the best. That way it connects our kinectic and visual learning and we get a full understanding of course material.
